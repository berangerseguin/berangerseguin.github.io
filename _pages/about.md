I have recently obtained a PhD in mathematics supervised by [Pierre Dèbes](http://math.univ-lille1.fr/~pde/) and [Ariane Mézard](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~ariane.mezard/).
You can [read the manuscript](https://lebarde.alwaysdata.net/phdyears/these.pdf) or [see the slides for the defense](https://lebarde.alwaysdata.net/phdyears/soutenance.pdf).
This work focuses around the geometric approach to the [regular inverse Galois problem](https://www.math.uci.edu/~mfried/deflist-cov/RIGP.html).
To this end, I have been studying the geometry and arithmetic of connected components of Hurwitz spaces, which are moduli spaces of branched covers of the projective line.
The links between the combinatorial, topological, and arithmetic points of view on this question are, in my eyes, as mysterious as they are fascinating, and it is with joy that I humbly try to contribute to their elucidation.

In parallel, I like to secretly travel to other mathematical landscapes:
* Grothendieck-Teichmüller theory and dessins d'enfants
* logic and proof theory (I am interested in formalization programs)
<!-- * higher category theory -->
* non-commutative algebra.

I love music - especially jazz - a lot, and I'm always glad to discuss music or jam around with people.
